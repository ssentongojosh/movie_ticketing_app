{% comment %}
    The `url` context variable is generated by Django's PasswordResetForm.
    It contains the full path including UID and token.
    However, we've set `PASSWORD_RESET_CONFIRM_URL` in settings to point to our frontend.
    So, we need to manually construct the URL using the `uid` and `token` from context.
